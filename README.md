# Sports Calendar Scraper
This NodeJS script scrapes my school's sports calendar and then sends me an email with the properly formatted events to read on the morning announcments at school.

### Todo
- [ ] Build GitHub Action to update .env vars (why tf is this so hard)
- [x] Create a way to format every event across all sports
- [x] Handle special events (swim/wrestling meets, golf matches, postponed events, rescheduled events, canceled events, etc.)
- [ ] Create a dynamic email formatter for all events (regular and special events)
- [ ] Scrape scores from games that happened the day before to report on announcements
