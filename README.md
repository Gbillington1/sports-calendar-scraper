# Sports Calendar Scraper
This NodeJS script scrapes my school's sports calendar and then sends me an email with the properly formatted events to read on the morning announcments at school.

### Todo
- [ ] Handle special events (swim/wrestling meets, golf matches, etc.)
- [ ] Configure RPI 
- [ ] Write cronjob `0 7 * * 1-5 node index.js`
