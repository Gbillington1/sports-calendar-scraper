# Sports Calendar Scraper
This NodeJS script scrapes my school's sports calendar and then sends me an email with the properly formatted events to read on the morning announcments at school.

### Todo
- [ ] Handle special events (swim/wrestling meets, golf matches, postponed events, rescheduled events, canceled events, etc.)
- [ ] Scrape scores from games that happened the day before to report on announcements
- [x] Configure RPI 
- [x] Write cronjob to run script every weekday at 7 AM `0 7 * * 1-5 bash runsportscalscraper.sh`
- [x] Write git deployment hook to automate deployment to RPI
